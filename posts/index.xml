      <description>Qadarallah, I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry to FairEmail, because they have stopped providing their services due to Google falsely flagged FairEmail as spyware without a reasonable opportunity to appeal, as stated on its website. The mail client has been irreplaceable on Android for me, come to an end. Though, you can still use their app without their service using an open standard.

      <description>The concept in which we host our own applications, data, and more. Taking away the “unknown” factor in how our data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of our data without losing the functionality of services we otherwise use frequently. That makes us much aware about our own privacy.</description>
